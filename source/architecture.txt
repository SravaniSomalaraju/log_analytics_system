Phase 6 - Hadoop Architecture Evolution Study

Task 7 - Architecture Comparison

Hadoop 1.x Architecture

Components:
NameNode -> Stores metadata
DataNode -> Stores actual data blocks
JobTracker -> Handles job scheduling + resource management
TaskTracker -> Executes map and reduce tasks

JobTracker & TaskTracker Limitations:
Single Point of Failure:-
-If JobTracker fails -> entire cluster stops.
Scalability Issues:-
-JobTracker manages both resource allocation and job scheduling → becomes bottleneck in large clusters.
Poor Resource Utilization:-
-Only MapReduce supported -> cannot run other processing frameworks.
Limited Cluster Size:-
-Not suitable for very large distributed systems.


Hadoop 2.x Architecture (Introduction of YARN)
Hadoop 2.x introduced YARN (Yet Another Resource Negotiator) to overcome Hadoop 1.x limitations.

YARN separates:
Resource management
Job execution

ResourceManager:
-Global cluster resource manager
-Allocates resources to applications
-Performs scheduling
NodeManager:
-Runs on each node
-Manages containers and resources
-Executes tasks
-Reports node status

ApplicationMaster:
-Created per application/job
-Negotiates resources from ResourceManager
-Manages execution of that specific job

Improvements over Hadoop 1.x:
-Removed JobTracker bottleneck
-Better scalability
-Multiple processing engines supported (MapReduce, Spark, Tez, etc.)
-Improved resource utilization
-Better fault tolerance

Hadoop 3.x Architecture (Modern Enhancements)
Hadoop 3.x builds on YARN with major improvements.

Key Enhancements:
High Availability (HA):
-Multiple NameNodes -> Active + Standby
-Automatic failover -> no single point of failure
Improved Scalability:
-Supports very large clusters
-Better resource scheduling and container management
Erasure Coding:
-Reduces storage overhead compared to replication
-More efficient storage utilization
Multiple Resource Types:
-Supports CPU, memory, GPU scheduling
